    # is there a way where ruby understands what the oder of the alphabet?
    # I want to try to make a library of the alphabet, get the index positions of that array and compare it to the current given array.
    "a" > "b" returns a false value, so ruby does recognize the alphapbet and that is has a value.
    # use if & elsif statements to move the index positions around.
  end

sorter.sort(["d", "b", "a", "c"])
# i need to take this array and turn it inro this ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
